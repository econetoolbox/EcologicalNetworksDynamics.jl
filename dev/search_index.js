This function only requires you to specify the trophic network.\n\nfw = [1 => 2, 2 => 3]\nmodel = default_model(fw)\n\nThis function will help you to create a model with ease, however it relies on default values for the parameters, which are not always suitable for your specific case, even though extracted from the literature.\n\nTo create a model with custom parameters, you can pass other arguments to default_model.\n\nmodel = default_model(fw, BodyMass(; Z = 100))\n\nFor instance, the above example creates a model with a body mass distribution with a predator-prey mass ratio of 100.\n\nIt is also possible to create a model manually by adding the components one by one. First, create an empty model:\n\nm = Model()\n\nThen add your components one by one. Note that you have to add the components in the right order, as some components depend on others. Moreover, some components are mandatory. Specifically, you need to provide a food web, species body masses, a functional response, metabolic rates and a producer growth function.\n\nm = Model()\nm += Foodweb([3 => 2, 2 => 1])\nm += ClassicResponse(; h = 2, M = BodyMass([0.1, 2, 3]))\nm += LogisticGrowth(; r = 1, K = 10)\nm += Metabolism(:Miele2019)\nm += Mortality(0)\n\nRead and write properties of the model\n\nFirst all properties contained in the model can be listed with:\n\nproperties(m) # Where m is a Model.\n\nThen, the value of a property can be read with get_<X> where X is the name of the property. For instance, to read mortality rates:\n\nget_mortality(m) # Equivalent to: m.mortality.\n\nYou can also re-write properties of the model using set_<X>!. However, not all properties can be re-written, because some of them are derived from the others. For instance, many parameters are derived from species body masses, therefore changing body masses would make the model inconsistent. However, terminal properties can be re-written, as the species metabolic rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"","page":"Welcome","title":"Welcome","text":"CurrentModule = EcologicalNetworksDynamics","category":"page"},{"location":"#EcologicalNetworksDynamics","page":"Welcome","title":"EcologicalNetworksDynamics","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Welcome","title":"Welcome","text":"EcologicalNetworksDynamics is a package designed to simulate species biomass dynamics in ecological networks.
