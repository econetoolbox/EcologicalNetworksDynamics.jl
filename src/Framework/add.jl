# Add components to the system: check and expand.
#
# The expansion procedure is rather general,
# as it assumes that several blueprints are added at once
# and that they constitute an ordered *forest*
# since they each may bring sub-blueprints.
#
# In addition, the caller can provide:
#   - `defaults`: a set of blueprints to be automatically added
#      if not explicitly provided as the main input.
#   - `hooks`: a set of sub-blueprints to be automatically brought
#      if either defaults or given blueprints require it.
#   - `excluded/without`: a set of components to explicitly *not* bring
#      from the defaults, or the hooks.
#
# The challenge here is to correctly check for conflicts/inconsistencies etc.
# and then pick a correct expansion order.
# Here is the general procedure without additional options:
#   - The forest is visited pre-order to collect the corresponding graph of sub-blueprints:
#     the one given by the caller are root nodes, and edges are colored depending on whether
#     the 'broughts' are 'embedded' or 'implied'.
#     - Error if an embedded blueprint brings a component already in the system.
#     - Ignore implied blueprints bringing components already in the system.
#     - Build implied blueprints if they are not already brought.
#     - Ignore implied blueprints if they are already brought.
#     - Error if any brought component is already brought by another blueprint
#       and the two differ.
#     - Error if any brought components was supposed to be excluded.
#   - When collection is over, decide whether to construct the defaults blueprints
#     and append them at the end of the forest,
#     pre-order again like an extension of the above step.
#   - Second traversal: visit the forest post-order to:
#     - Error if any brought component conflicts with components already in the system.
#     - Check requirements/conflicts against components already brought in pre-order.
#     - Trigger any required 'hook' by appending them to the forest (pre-order)
#       if this can avoid a 'MissingRequiredComponent' error.
#     - Run the `early_check`.
#     - Record requirements to determine the expansion order.
#   - Consume the forest from requirements to dependents to:
#     - Run the late `check`.
#     - Expand the blueprint into a component.
#     - Execute possible triggers.

# Prepare thorough analysis of recursive sub-blueprints possibly brought
# by the blueprints given.
# Reify the underlying 'forest' structure.
