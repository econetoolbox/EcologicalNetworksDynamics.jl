# Measuring species and community stability

Often, one is interested in assessing the **stability**
of a simulated ecological community and the species it comprises.
However, stability can be measured in *many* different ways
depending on the context and goals of the analysis.

To support this, we have developed a dedicated package:
[`EcoNetPostProcessing.jl`](https://github.com/econetoolbox/EcoNetPostProcessing.jl).

This companion tool provides a suite of methods for analyzing simulation results
and computing a variety of stability metrics.

For full details, please refer to this package
[documentation](https://econetoolbox.github.io/EcoNetPostProcessing.jl/).
